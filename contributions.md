I wrote out the plan for how we will get started on our group project. They can be seen in the "what is your plan for getting started" section on our [initial-presentation](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/sklearn-logistics/blob/master/initial_presentation/initial-presentation.md) notes.    |

|  9   | [First Contribution to Group Project: Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/13533)    | Group Project: Scikit-Learn    |   This is my first real contribution to my group project. I raised an issue on the project's Issues page about a "todo" task I found in the project's documentation. Later, I found several more such tasks. I'm in talks with the admins on github and on the project's IRC to see how they would like for us to fix all these issues.    |
|  11   | [Commit to our team's fork of Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/scikit-learn/commit/2a34d6ab371acc751c748cb5b76084b07ac43279)    | Group Project: Scikit-Learn    |   This is my contribution to the "todo" comments I found in the documentation and divided evenly amongst my team members. This will be our first significant change to the project, once checked and merged.    |
