|  7   | [Updated relevant file in Group Project's Logistics Repo](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/sklearn-logistics/commit/e4eb559f02444c76d138695f264a82918d251675)    | Group Project: Logistics Repo    |   I updated the "skills and abilities" file on our group's logistics repo with my own skills and abilities.   |
|  7   | [Contribution to first group presentation notes](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/sklearn-logistics/commit/e4eb559f02444c76d138695f264a82918d251675)    | Group Project: Logistics Repo    |   I updated our notes for our first ever group presentation. I wrote out the plan for how we will get started on our group project. They can be seen in the "what is your plan for getting started" section on our [initial-presentation](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/sklearn-logistics/blob/master/initial_presentation/initial-presentation.md) notes.    |
|  7   | [Updated Logistics Repo's README](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/sklearn-logistics/commit/3519f151404b8f9270d80989689c585a3e09fc2b)    | Group Project: Logistics Repo    |   I added team member names to our logistics repo's README.    |
|  9   | [First Contribution to Group Project: Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/13533)    | Group Project: Scikit-Learn    |   This is my first real contribution to my group project. I raised an issue on the project's Issues page about a "todo" task I found in the project's documentation. Later, I found several more such tasks. I'm in talks with the admins on github and on the project's IRC to see how they would like for us to fix all these issues.    |
|  11   | [Commit to our team's fork of Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/scikit-learn/commit/2a34d6ab371acc751c748cb5b76084b07ac43279)    | Group Project: Scikit-Learn    |   This is my contribution to the "todo" comments I found in the documentation and divided evenly amongst my team members. This will be our first significant change to the project, once checked and merged.    |
|  12   | [Comment on a previously raised issue that I wanted, but it got taken](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/12793)    | Group Project: Scikit-Learn    |   This seemed like a fixable issue, that I wanted to take up, but someone else (very unethically) took the issue without commenting and made a PR. I hope it does not work out for this person.    |
|  12   | [Pull request to Scikit-Learn about TODO issue raised by me](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13660)    | Group Project: Scikit-Learn    |   This is my PR for the "todo" comments I found in the documentation and divided amongst my team members. We all added our pieces to the page, and I made a PR to the main project.    |
|  12   | [Made suggested changes to PR as per maintainer's advice](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13660/commits/7ee238c911f953798b655f864f781fe1fe9959c2)    | Group Project: Scikit-Learn    |   I made changes to our work according by the suggestions made my the maintainers.    |
|  13   | [Made final presentation base for team](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/sklearn-logistics/commit/f6747baf37492e6b75007dae348f5f8ce5413044)    | Group Project: Scikit-Learn    |   I created and updated the final presentation folder on our logistics repo. I made many subsequent commits, but I'm adding the one that contains the creation.     |
|  13   | [Added notes and sections for final presentation](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/sklearn-logistics/commit/8c1451f14daffdab5a4601497b194361b3810675)    | Group Project: Scikit-Learn    |   Here too I had a lot of commits, but I'm adding one with most changes.    |
|  14   | [Opened new and perhaps final issue for Group project](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/13851)    | Group Project: Scikit-Learn    |   I found two sets of "advanced installation instructions" on the website, and opened an issue about the what the instructions lack information about in terms of Mac OSX installation.     |
