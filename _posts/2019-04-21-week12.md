## Thoughts on Kevin Fleming’s Talk

Kevin Fleming’s talk was incredibly informative, and worth the wait. I loved hearing about both his and Bloomberg’s background with open source because as a relatively new member of the open source community myself, I get encouraged by hearing about other people’s beginnings. 

**_What I found most interesting…_**

I thought it was really interesting that Bloomberg not only allows but encourages its employees to fix open source tools, 

**_What I found most surprising…_**

The fact that Bloomberg processes over 100B market messages a day. 


## Personal Progress: Team Project (Sci-kit Learn)

This week I made our first major pull request to the project. Once we all completed the todo tasks assigned to us, I reviewed and pushed the code to our fork. Then, I made a PR that passed all the checks necessary for a possible merge. 

Our PR was reviewed, and one of the maintainers suggested some changes that I made and committed two days later. The updated PR has also passed all the checks and is now under review, with a possible merge coming very soon. 

On our team meeting day next week, I will suggest more issues we could work on as a team, and in the meanwhile work on smaller individual issues as well.
