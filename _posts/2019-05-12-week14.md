### Week 14: Team Presentations and Final Few Contributions


## My Contribution to Sci-Kit Learn


I'm still in talks with the admins to see why our PR is failing the cloud test. 
It is yet to be merged, but I hope we get an answer before we wind down for the semester. 


I've also opened a new and perhaps final issue for our project. Earlier in the semester I found an extra set of 
"advanced installation isntructions" on the project website, and I'm trying to figure out why this is the case.
