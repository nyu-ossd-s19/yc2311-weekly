### Week 5: Project Evaluations (Continued)

## License Evaluation

The license being used by the project is Mozilla Public License 2.0 

The license is easy to read and understand. Here are some surface level details that one gets with a simple read:
A user can…
* Sublicense
* Modify Code
* Distribute Code

A user cannot…
* Use the trademark
* Hold the organization liable

A user must…
* Include license
* Include copyright
* Disclose the source

## Installing the Development Environment

The dev environment was easy to install, with fairly detailed instructions.

However, it seems to me like someone who is not aware of general iOS development protocols might have a hard time understanding all the instructions due to use of technical or terse instructions that might be cryptic for newbies. 

If I could improve on these instructions, I would try to make it more beginner friendly by adding links to some basic definitions for newbies to use as reference.
