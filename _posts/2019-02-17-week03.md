My Experience with Working on the Browser Extension Project

Working on our team’s browser extension project was an incredible experience. We created an email detector extension that detects all emails on a web page. The collaborative aspect of the activity was perhaps the best part about it since our team got along really well, with assigned roles and responsibilities from day one. 

I was in-charge of code styling; I borrowed style features from Airbnb and MDN guides to create our project’s own style guide. I also modified existing code to match our team’s standards. 


Working with My Team

I believe my team got along really well, and functioned like a well oiled machine from day one. We all had assigned roles and responsibilities, and every member seemed to deliver more than what was asked. 

Our collaboration was completely remote since we didn’t feet the need to meet. 


Team Decisions and Communication 

Decision-making was smooth, with all team members always on board with changes and modifications. All communication was primarily through Messenger and Github.
