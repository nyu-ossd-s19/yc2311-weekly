### Week 13: Winding Down and Team Contributions


## My Contribution to Sci-Kit Learn

I modified our defintions for the todo comments to include all suggested changes. This involced changing two of our defintions entirely, and the formatting for a third. 

The PR is up, but it now fails a test due to some cloud update. I'm currently following up on the issue, but it should be notes that the test we fail isn't a critical one, and our PR can still be merged in time. 

I've also started working on our final presentation, and am in talks with the community to see what kind of impact our team has made.
