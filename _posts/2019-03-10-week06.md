### Week 6: Humanitarian Open Source and Projects for Social Good

## My Take on Using Open Source for Social Good

#### Are such projects easier or harder to get involved with?
I believe such projects are easier to get involved with due to the natural alignment of open source to humanitarian values. 

#### Does involvement in such projects bring more or less prestige to the contributor as compared to other projects?
I don't think the idea of prestige should be included here. If a coder's passions and interests ring with a project for social good, then getting involved migh be a good idea. If not, then the coder should take up what seems most fulfilling. The ultimate aim is to add value to the world in one way or another, and I believe that can be best achieved if we feel passionate about the projects we take up. 

#### Would I be involved in a project like that?
I would love to be involved in an open source project for social good. Aligining my skills and passions with something that makes the world a better place will bring me great joy, and a kind professional fulfillment that could be hard to attain.
