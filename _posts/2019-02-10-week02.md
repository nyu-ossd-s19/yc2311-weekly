### Week 2: Web Extension Project & Github Activity

## My Contributions to the Web Extention Project

Our team is creating an email detector extension, coded in JS, html, and css.

I made stylistic changes to the entire code base to get it in line with our team’s selected coding standards. 
The coding styles we picked were up from the Airbnb JS style guide, and from the MDN extension guide.

I also made changes to our project’s README and Contributing files to reflect these changes. 


## State of Our Web Extension Project

Our project seems to be on schedule, and we expect to have a working product by the due date. 
The extension can detect emails, making it functional as per the aim of the project. 
We are now discussing stylistic changes, along with other possible features. 


## What I learned about Github?

I learned that fork is a feature that’s exclusive to Github. 

I also learned about some of the underlying mechanics behind project management through Github.
