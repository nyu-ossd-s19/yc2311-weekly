First and foremost - since my name can be hard to pronounce, I go by Yuvi. 

I believe I was born to do something big in life and once the realization kicked in that I couldn’t be a soccer star or a stand-up comedian (I wasn’t close), it became clear that my future lies in the world of technology. 

I’ve always looked at the field as a means to empower people; for this reason, I’ve accepted a software engineering role at a beauty company that empowers its consumers with constant innovation in beauty technology. 

Another field of interest to me, that I wish to explore with my knowledge in tech, is psychology (more particularly, psychoanalysis). Having read many books that deal with the field, including Japanese mystery and thriller novels, I wish to someday create a bot with affective capabilities.
